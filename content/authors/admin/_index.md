I am a strength and conditioning coach based the Sports Surgery Clinic (SSC) in Dublin, where I am Clinical Lead for Foot and Ankle Rehabilitation. My role involves managing a clinical team and treating complex lower limb injuries. Combined with my clinical role, I am currently undertaking a PhD at the University of Côte d’Azur in France investigating Achilles tendinopathy rehabilitation and lower limb biomechanics.
 
I have been working at the SSC since 2014. Prior to that I enjoyed a long career in elite sport as an Irish international athlete who competed at the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games in the 50km Walk. Some of my career highlights included finishing 10th at the 2010 European Championships and 12th at the 2012 World Cup, as well as previously holding the Irish record for the 50km walk. Since retiring from my race walking career in 2013, I have been a regular participant in domestic road races with a marathon PB of 2.23.00 and half marathon 68.51. I also provides strength and conditioning support to some leading Irish athletes and coaches a number of distance runners. 

I come from Ballinamore in county Leitrim but live in Dublin with my wife and daughter.
